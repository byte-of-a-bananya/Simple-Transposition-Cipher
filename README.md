In a transposition cipher, the word is encoded by using a keyword known both to the sender and to the receiver. The message is put into columns, then the columns are scrambled to form a new word.

Input: All data will be read from a file. The first item to be read is a letter representing “E” for encrypt or “D” for decrypt, followed by a String representing the keyword, then another String that is to be either encrypted or decrypted. There will be an undisclosed number of items to be either encrypted or decrypted.

Output: The encrypted or decrypted message test data
